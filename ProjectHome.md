Microsoft Authorisation Manager (AzMan) is a useful tool for adding authorisation to your app, but the API is....well a bit shoddy.

This is an attempt to wrap up access to authorisation stores in a more friendly, more managed API.

XML & AD is initially planned. Support for actually doing the auth checking may also be added (right now, it's more of a management API)
